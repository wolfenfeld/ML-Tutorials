**Data Scientist**: The data-lake was angry that day, my friends - like an old analyst trying to use vim for the first time. I ran about fifty cells in the notebook and suddenly, the great dataset appeared before me.

I tell you he was ten Terabytes if it was uncompressed. As if sensing my presence, it let out a great out of memory warning. I said, "Easy, big fella!" And then, as I watched memory usage climb through the roof, I realized that something was obstructing its memory management. From where I was standing, I could see directly into record file.

**Data Engineer**: Log file.

**Data Scientist**: Whatever.

**Developer**: Well, what did you do next?

**Data scientist**: Well then, from out of nowhere, a back-end developer ran a git fetch command on my machine, cleared all my notebook cells, and I found myself right on top of it - face to face with the init function. I could barely understand from the lack of documentation, but I knew something was there. So I ran in debug mode, felt around, and pulled out the obstruction.

**Data Scientist**: [reveals a code snippet]

**Developer**: What is that, a for loop?

**Data Scientist**: [nods head]
