As data scientist we often need to estimate a value in order to answer a certain business question.
In most cases we get a data set, and the value that we wish to estimate is the mean and so the sample mean is a good choice for an estimator.

However, the arithmetic mean is not always the best choice for all the cases. 
There are also the geometric mean and the harmonic mean that can be used.

But before we get into the difference between all these means and what is the best choice for different cases I would like to start from the top and ask a more fundamental questions - what is an estimator?

Well, a good definition that I found states:
> An estimator is a statistic that estimates some fact about the population. 
> You can also think of an estimator as the rule that creates an estimate.

If we take this and apply it to what we started with:
Given the data set and the business question, we wish to construct the rule that will answer the business question form the data.

Lets consider several examples and see which means fits best for each case

1. A particle travels a certain distance _x_ in a certain velocity _v_ in time _t_ and we wih to estimate the next particle velocity.
Given a sample of particle velocities we wish estimate the mean velocity.

We can assume that the following holds:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_i v_i \cdot t_i &=  \sum_i x_i 
\end{aligned}
$$

In this case we are looking for a fixed value v̄	that if we replace our individual velocities with it, the following claim will hold:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_i \bar{v} \cdot t_i &=  \sum_i x_i 
\end{aligned}
$$

and in our case where all the particles travel the same distance of _x_ we get for the left hand side of the equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{v} \sum_i t_i &= \bar{v} \sum_i \frac{x}{v_i} &= \bar{v} \sum_i \frac{1}{v_i}\\[2em]
\end{aligned}
$$

and for the right hand side we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sum_i x_i &= n \cdot x\\[2em]
\end{aligned}
$$

and finally we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{v} \sum_i \frac{1}{v_i} &= n \cdot x\\[2em]
    \bar{v}  &= \frac{n}{\sum_i \frac{1}{v_i}}
\end{aligned}
$$

To conclude this case  - we will need the harmonic mean in this case.

2. In another case a different particle breaks down or dissolves after _t_ time, traveling a distance of _x_ with the velocity of _v_, and yet again we wish to estimate the mean velocity.

As in the previous case we will be looking for a fixed value that will satisfy the same equation 

$$ \sum_i \bar{v}\cdot t_i = \sum_i x_i $$

In this case _t_ is the same for all the particles and we can say the following for the left hand side:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sum_i \bar{v}\cdot t_i &=  n \cdot t\cdot \bar{v}
\end{aligned}
$$

and for the right hand side we can say:

$$
\begin{aligned}
     \sum_i x_i &=  \sum_i t \cdot v_i &= t \sum_i v_i 
\end{aligned}
$$

and from there we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
     n \cdot t\cdot \bar{v} &= t \sum_i v_i\\[2em]
      \bar{v} &= \frac{\sum_i v_i}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

to conclude - in this case the mean velocity is the arithmetic mean of the samples.
 
3. In this case we will take a look at a population of germs/rabbits/ewoks, were in each time step _t_ the population grows by αₜ. 
We are given the data of the population at step till step _T_ anw we wish to estimate the population at _T_ + _τ_.

In this case the population can be described as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
     P_t = \prod_{i=0}^T t_0\cdot \alpha_i 
\end{aligned}
$$

and we are looking for a fixed value α, that will hold the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
     P_t = \prod_{i=0}^T t_0\cdot \alpha 
\end{aligned}
$$

We can derive from the previous formula

$$
\begin{aligned}
     \prod_i^T P_0\cdot \alpha &= P_0\prod_i \cdot \alpha_i^t\\[2em]
     P_0\cdot \alpha^T &= P_0\prod_i \cdot \alpha_i^t\\[2em]
     \alpha^T &= \prod_i \cdot \alpha_i^t\\[2em]
     \alpha &= \sqrt[T]{\prod_i \cdot \alpha_i^t}
\end{aligned}
$$
